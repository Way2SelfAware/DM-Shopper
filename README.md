DM Shopper is a Full Stack Dungeons and Dragons E-commerce Web Application designed to streamline the shopping experience for Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players. The primary goal is to save time for DMs by providing a platform where they can easily send a shopping experience to their players, allowing them to browse and purchase items within the D&D universe. This not only enhances the overall gameplay by reducing administrative overhead but also provides an immersive user experience with a D&D-themed interface. The target users are Dungeon Masters who want to enhance their players' engagement by integrating a seamless and thematic shopping aspect into their campaigns. While the project presents an exciting opportunity for an immersive user experience, it also poses challenges due to the complexity of handling both backend and frontend development. The lack of budget and me as the sole developer with a limited time commitment will influence the scope and pace of the project.
